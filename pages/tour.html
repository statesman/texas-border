## The retired park ranger

From 2,500 feet above the desert floor, Marcos Paredes, 60, who served as a river ranger for 25 years for the National Park Service, sweeps his hand across the window of his Cessna 205, gesturing to the view before him.

“A lot of this area doesn’t have roads; by building roads to build a wall, you’ll be providing access, creating a problem where there isn’t one,” he says. “Don’t for a minute think a wall will keep them from coming.”

“This country is huge. Getting across the river is the easy part; getting to the river, or away from the river is the hard part,” he says.

As a ranger, he says he pulled at least a dozen dead bodies of crossers from the rugged terrain of Big Bend Ranch State Park.

The current Border Patrol checkpoints — one exists just south of Alpine, nearly 100 miles north of the border — is much more sensible than a wall, he says. “The only way out of this country is the highway,” he says.

## The college kids

A group of University of Michigan students pointed their car south, and, about 1,700 miles later, a sunny midday found them frolicking in the Rio Grande, beside the ancient hot springs — a remnant of the volcanic activity that once reshaped this land.

“It’d be a crime to put anything through here,” said Gisela McDaniel, a senior art student.

She takes a break from swimming to jot down some ideas in her Moleskine notebook, full of collages and drawings of her cat.

Brian Keener, majoring in English and environmental law and policy, who has let down his dark, shoulder-length hair, said: “I’m not sure the Trump administration is the most responsible about looking into what the environmental consequences will be. I see the national parks as museums of nature that welcome everyone. A wall negates the ecological benefits of setting up these parks in the first place.”

## The retirees

From a cliff overlooking a near-teal Rio Grande, Mary Drum, 66, can spot a couple of horsemen on the opposite shore.

“The wall is needed now,” she says. She and her husband, who live in Northeast Texas, are out snapping nature pictures, one of their hobbies. “Those people are waiting to come across at night.”

“Looks like the mountains would be plenty of barrier, but there’s miles and miles between them,” says her husband, Tom Drum, 68. “They can sleep in the day and then walk at night.”

“You gotta be reasonable and preserve the Earth, otherwise man would destroy himself: This is about the survival of mankind. There’s lots of room on this side of the river and on that side of the river for men and wildlife.”

Tom Drum had a career in sales, doing book distribution and then going to Bible College before managing a western-wear store in Baton Rouge, La.

Mary Drum thinks she has enough shots now of Big Bend to make a full calendar — she’s made calendars in the past from their trip to Oregon.

## The tour guide

Erin Little, 36, drives a white van with a trio of canoes rigged up to the back.

She tells the visitors she is about to lead on a canoe trek through the steep-walled Santa Elena Canyon, 1,000-foot drop-offs one either side of the Rio Grande, about how to make tea out of ocotillo flowers or a salve out of cresote, beeswax and olive oil or where to find hip-high bluebonnets.

Little wears earrings from Copper Canyon in Chihuahua and likes to head to the Mexican border town of Ojinaga for produce: A cart full of papayas and pineapples and bananas and jalapeños and other victuals goes for $40: the same items would cost $240 on the U.S. side, she says.

“You’re lucky you’re taking this trip now,” she tells the five customers of the Far Flung Outdoor Center, one of at least four outfitters in Terlingua and Study Butte that operate expeditions on the Rio Grande. If a wall gets built, “I’m going to be out of a job and you’re going to be out of a river trip.”

## The Lewinsky theory

“Do you want to hear my Lewinsky theory?” says George Hirsch.

He and his wife, Sandy, both 60-year-old school teachers in southern Ontario, Canada, took their pickup truck and trailer on the road in early February; as dusk rounds its way onto the Rio Grande, an aquamarine ribbon making its way through the gathering shadows, they’re setting up in Upper Madera Canyon, just west of Lajitas.

“Monica Lewinsky was used as a distraction from China: Not that it was her choice, but she played a valuable role politically speaking,” says Hirsch — he clearly has been stewing over this, the way one does when driving an RV across North America for four weeks. “The (border) wall is a big distraction. Nobody really wants a wall and it’s never really going to happen. Trump is like a magician.”

“I understand animals — wildlife — need to move back and forth,” he says. The wall talk “befuddles me. It functionally cannot happen.”

## Tornillo Flat

Seventy million years ago, duckbill dinosaurs fed on water plants in the river floodplain here. And during the last ice age, thousands of years ago, mammoths thrived, eating up to 500 pounds of plant life a day to sustain themselves.

Gazing out over this tableau, now desert and part of Big Bend National Park, is Nancy Mercer, a 65 year-old tourist from Central Pennsylvania.

“Sometimes security is worth it,” she says about the prospect of a 30-foot wall cutting through this open space. “We used to always leave our houses unlocked; not anymore.”

“The drugs are coming from somewhere,” she says — and points south, to Mexico.

Last year, 41,752 pounds of marijuana and 16 pounds of cocaine were confiscated by U.S. Border Patrol in the Big Bend Sector.

## Opposition on Falcon Lake

When Abel Garza, a 74-year-old Vietnam War veteran, retired from teaching a few years ago, he dedicated himself to a life of fishing. Almost every day he can be found along the shores of Falcon Lake, casting for largemouth bass. “My wife loves seafood,” he says, so his retirement plan has worked out nicely.

But Garza’s mood darkens when he’s asked about the possibility of a border wall or fence around Falcon Lake, the largest reservoir on the Rio Grande.

“Where are they gonna put it? In the middle of the lake? Outside the town?” he asked. “We won’t allow it. That’s a bunch of bull.”

It’s a common refrain on the shores of Falcon Lake, which hosts numerous bass fishing competitions throughout the year and whose shores are crowded with subdivisions, RV parks and fishing-related businesses.

“If a wall were built and we would somehow lose access to the lake, it would decimate our economy,” said Zapata County Judge Joe Rathmell. “I don’t think it’s feasible or practical to build a wall here.”

## Working both sides

Arnold Lopez has crossed back and forth across the border fence so many times that he hardly sees it anymore.

As an executive with a local agricultural company, Lopez keeps a keen eye on fields of kale, cabbage and cilantro that sit south of the fence in the town of Peñitas. His company has fields on both sides of the wall, and Border Patrol agents know him and his truck by sight. “It’s hardly an inconvenience,” he says. “It’s not like it’s the Berlin Wall or anything.”

The fields bear evidence of the proximity to the river. At the irrigation pumps set up along the river’s edge it’s not uncommon to find discarded clothes or plastic bags. On a recent afternoon a deflated raft was caught on carrizo stalk along the shoreline. A baby’s diaper was inside an old concrete pipe. “You put two and two together,” said Lopez, a fourth-generation farmer who used to work on his grandparents’ farm across the river in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. “This brings those things to life.”

## The ancient giant

One of the few tourist attractions in the border town of Abrams, the Montezuma bald cypress, called ahuehuete or “old man of the water” by the Aztecs, is more than 900 years old. The well-known tree sits just south of the border fence, past an opening that is often guarded by Border Patrol agents.

The Rio Grande used to be lined with similar massive cypress trees, which are the national tree of Mexico, but many were cut down to build wharves at the Brownsville port. According to the Sierra Club, only a few original Montezuma bald cypress trees remain in the Rio Grande Valley.

## Safer than Omaha

The Chimney Rock RV Resort in Mission enjoys a privileged location. It’s built right along the river’s edge, and the Rio Grande flows just a few feet from the shuffleboard court. Cozy cottages have prized views of the water.

Despite the proximity to Mexico and the occasional migrant who crosses through the park headed north, residents say they don’t feel fearful. “I’ve never had so much as a bicycle stolen,” said Ruth Anderson, a Nebraska resident who has wintered here for a decade. “I feel safer here than when I go to Omaha.”

A Border Patrol truck is stationed at the park nearly 24/7, Anderson said.

Yet Anderson said she would not be upset if a wall were built around the RV park. It would most likely be built on top of a levee that already serves as a sort of exterior wall. “There will still be a gate (at the entrance),” she said. “We’ll roll with it. The wall wouldn’t change much.”

## Birders blocked

A stone’s throw from the international bridge connecting Reynosa, Mexico, to the city of Hidalgo, Andres Flores is building a unique set of bird feeders.

The Old Hidalgo Pumphouse, built in 1909, was shut down in 1983 and has since been converted into a museum, with finely manicured grounds and walking trails. The pumphouse, run by the city of Hidalgo, is also part of the World Birding Center, which has nine locations in the Rio Grande Valley.

But birders often leave the Pumphouse disappointed. The border fence runs along the center’s southern edge, and a massive, shuttered gate blocks access to a nature trail leading through flood plain woodlands to the Rio Grande.

“We would love to have that access, but we don’t,” said Flores, the director of the Pumphouse. The area behind the fence is considered a premier spot to find rare birds, but the trails have become overgrown, Flores said. Border Patrol agents who guard the fence say the refuge has become dangerous, with lurking smugglers.

So Flores decided to build the birdfeeders in hopes of coaxing some of those prized birds out of the refuge. He is building the feeders using materials from the abandoned ladders Border Patrol agents often find leaning against the wall.

It’s an irony that’s not lost on Flores. “We are putting them to good use,” he said. “It’s just part of life around here.”

## Strange configuration

The border fence assumes strange configurations near the Los Indios international bridge, with large gaps and irregularly placed sections of steel. The surrounding area was the subject of numerous condemnation lawsuits against local property owners and a title dispute between the federal government and the Cameron County Irrigation District.

In internal communications obtained by the University of Texas, Border Patrol agents complained that wall placement was being driven by the push to finish quickly and the cost of obtaining rights of way from landowners.

“I was advised that funding and timelines are driving this deployment, not operational need,” wrote one Border Patrol commander in 2007.

## A different golf hazard

As the fence continues west, it stops abruptly at the edge of the River Bend Resort and Golf Club, picking back up on the other side of the resort, which is home to a large number of winter Texans.

The resort’s owners have argued the fence would slice through the golf course, leaving 15 holes, along with dozens of houses, to the south and three holes to the north. Federal officials left it off the previous construction plans, and residents hope that the Trump wall won’t fill in the gap.

“It’s a concern,” said Reggie Rennels, a retiree from Illinois who lives with his wife at the resort for half the year. “If it happens, it would destroy the community.
“The decision-makers need to come to River Bend and see the impact it would have on us.”

## Final resting place fenced

Founded before 1890, the Santa Rosalia Cemetery used to house the family plots for the Santa Rosalia Ranch, one of the largest in Brownsville in the last century. Today, the cemetery sits south of the border fence; visitors must cross through an opening on the levee road and drive half a mile past farmland to reach the remote burial place.

The cemetery is still active, despite its forbidding location. Several dozen tombs — some well-tended, others overgrown — remain, many with American flags flying overhead.

## ‘People think we live in Mexico’

Most mornings, 19-year-old Greg Garcia passes through an opening in the rusting, 18-foot high steel fence on his way to classes at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville, where he studies the air conditioning sciences.

On his way home, he drives south past the border wall. More often than not he is waved through by Border Patrol agents who have come to recognize his truck. If there’s a new agent on the wall, he might get stopped and asked a few questions. It’s something he’s gotten used to over the last half decade.

“I’ve had some family members say to us, ‘when we come over to the house, do we need to bring some legal documents to get back?’” he said. “People think we live in Mexico. Actual Mexico.”

Garcia and his family are among a handful of Texas residents caught south of the wall when it was built under the Bush and later Obama administrations. They live in a hard-to-define third space, between river and wall, that stretches in fits and starts from Brownsville, through the Rio Grande Valley and reappears in places like Eagle Pass.

Because of flooding concerns, difficulties in obtaining access to private property, and the wildly undulating path of the Rio Grande, the border fence in many cases was built far from the river’s edge, leaving an entire ecosystem in this no-man’s land.

## South of the wall

On the edge of Brownsville, a curious sign announces an upcoming tourist attraction: “Through the fence, over the levee … No passport needed!”

The Sabal Palm Sanctuary is encircled by the border fence. A gap allows visitors to dart through the fence, the opening nearly always shadowed by a Border Patrol SUV. For some visitors, it’s disconcerting. “Some will call and ask; they have to be reassured that they’re not crossing the border,” said one employee who didn’t want to be identified.

The sanctuary is home to one of the region’s last remaining groves of towering Sabal Palms, which used to line the Rio Grande for hundreds of miles, as well as hundreds of bird and animal species.

For some visitors, the sensation of being south of the wall yet still in the U.S. is a strange one. Standing in a blind overlooking a grove of Sabal Palms, Gloria Regis, a visitor from Michigan, says it’s peaceful, but also “feels like no-man’s land. I wouldn’t want to know I’m not considered in the U.S. in this side of the Rio Grande.”

## Backyard border fence

The backyard of Juan Solís’ Brownsville home, lush with fruit trees and a thick carpet of St. Augustine grass, ends suddenly at the soaring steel poles of the border fence. The fence curves beyond eye level in either direction. From plastic chairs positioned under a papaya tree, Solís, 79, can peer through the gaps in the poles, at the rich farmland on the other side. The river is about a mile away. In his front yard, where a Texas A&M flag marks the school of two of his grandchildren, Solís says he sees a steady stream of Border Patrol and DPS vehicles doing laps.

Solís, who’s lived in this neighborhood all his life, says he’s gotten used to his new backyard fence; he hardly sees it anymore as he tends to his garden and grass. “You get used to it,” he sighed on a recent afternoon.

But still, the fence is a reminder of how much has changed in the neoghborhood where was born and raised. When he was a boy, neighborhood kids would escapee the oppressive Brownsville summer heat by running down to the Rio Grande and splashing in the river’s cool waters.

Those days are long gone. Solís said it now requires a two-mile hike around the fence to get to the river. “And Border Patrol has told us not to go (to the river) because many people are coming over with contraband and it’s dangerous,” he said. “Now no kids can go down there.”
