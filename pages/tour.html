## Juan Solís

The backyard of Juan Solís’ Brownsville home, lush with fruit trees and a thick carpet of St. Augustine grass, ends suddenly at the soaring steel poles of the border fence. The fence curves beyond eye level in either direction. From plastic chairs positioned under a papaya tree, Solís, 79, can peer through the gaps in the poles, at the rich farmland on the other side. The river is about a mile away. In his front yard, where a Texas A&M flag marks the school of two of his grandchildren, Solís says he sees a steady stream of Border Patrol and DPS vehicles doing laps.

Solís, who’s lived in this neighborhood all his life, says he’s gotten used to his new backyard fence; he hardly sees it anymore as he tends to his garden and grass. “You get used to it,” he sighed on a recent afternoon.

But still, the fence is a reminder of how much has changed in the neoghborhood where was born and raised. When he was a boy, neighborhood kids would escapee the oppressive Brownsville summer heat by running down to the Rio Grande and splashing in the river’s cool waters.

Those days are long gone. Solís said it now requires a two-mile hike around the fence to get to the river. “And Border Patrol has told us not to go (to the river) because many people are coming over with contraband and it’s dangerous,” he said. “Now no kids can go down there.”

## Greg Garcia

Most mornings, 19-year-old Greg Garcia passes through an opening in the rusting, 18-foot high steel fence on his way to classes at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville, where he studies the air conditioning sciences.

On his way home, he drives south past the border wall. More often than not he is waved through by Border Patrol agents who have come to recognize his truck. If there’s a new agent on the wall, he might get stopped and asked a few questions. It’s something he’s gotten used to over the last half decade.

“I’ve had some family members say to us, ‘when we come over to the house, do we need to bring some legal documents to get back?’” he said. “People think we live in Mexico. Actual Mexico.”

Garcia and his family are among a handful of Texas residents caught south of the wall when it was built under the Bush and later Obama administrations. They live in a hard-to-define third space, between river and wall, that stretches in fits and starts from Brownsville, through the Rio Grande Valley and reappears in places like Eagle Pass.

Because of flooding concerns, difficulties in obtaining access to private property, and the wildly undulating path of the Rio Grande, the border fence in many cases was built far from the river’s edge, leaving an entire ecosystem in this no-man’s land.
