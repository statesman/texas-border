# Texas border series

An index and some related pages on on an occasional series on issues that pertain to a growing border wall.

It's built on the immersive template rig, as outlined below.

- An index that is an overview of the project
- A vertical scroll photo gallery with maps of where the photos were taken. `tour.html`
- There is one story, `noman.html`, that is inside this project. All the other stories are published in Methode and we just link to them from the index
- There is a special tease for Methode. See below:

## Tease for methode
There is a special layout called `tease.hbs` that allows us to publish just an HTML snipped that we then embed into Methode as a tease. It uses NPR's [pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/) to make it responsive in the mystatesman.com page.

We had to add a bit of inline CSS to the code to make it behave the way we wanted. This below is the tease embed code with the CSS. This was inserted as a code block after the 2nd or 3rd graf in the Methode stories.

``` html
<!-- This is tease text to insert into Methode -->
<style>
@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {
    div#tease {    
      width: 50%;
      float: right;
      margin-left: 12px;
    }
}
</style>
<div id="tease"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>
    var pymParent = new pym.Parent('tease', '//host.coxmediagroup.com/aas/projects/news/texas-border/tease.html', {});
</script>
```

``` html

<scriptblock><![CDATA[<style>@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {div#tease {width: 50%; float: right; margin-left: 12px; } } </style> <div id="tease"></div> <script type="text/javascript" src="//pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js"></script> <script> var pymParent = new pym.Parent('tease', '//host.coxmediagroup.com/aas/projects/news/texas-border/tease.html', {}); </script>]]></scriptblock>

## immersive-template

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

This project is our go-to tool for generating multipage, off-platform immersive story presentations.

A few key features:
- a Grunt and Handlebars-driven generator that bakes out flat HTML files
- a Connect server for development with livereload
- ready-to-tweak Bootstrap styles and scripts, compiled with Grunt and linted with [Bootlint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint)
- partials for often-used elements (photo blocks of various sizes, Brightcove videos, etc.)
- helpers for common tasks (nav and URL generation)
- easy deployment using FTP to our Cox infrastructure

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Grunt

## Setup

Download and unpack this repo:
```
$ curl -OL https://github.com/statesman/immersive-template/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip -d YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
$ cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```
Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

### Project structure

First things first, you should probably understand where everything lives and what all of these folders are for:

`helpers/`: contains Handlebars helpers, which are structured as Node.js modules (in the [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS) format).

`layouts/`: these are Handlebars templates that are used to wrap the content you create in the `pages/` folder

`pages/`: this is your content and everything that's in this folder will be automatically parsed by grunt and made available to users in the `public/` folder

`partials/`: these are little snippets, in the Handlebars partials format, that can be used to generate slideshows, inline photos, etc.

`public/`: in production, this is the folder that actually serves the project (or it can be the only piece of the project you actually move to production)

`src/css/`: `less` files that Grunt will transpile into CSS in `public/dist/style.css`

`src/js/`: JavaScript files that Grunt will concatenate, Uglify and save in `public/dist/scripts.js`

`src/assets/`: This is where images, logos, etc. live. It's the only save place in `dist/` to put things because most everything else in that folder is auto-cleaned by Grunt.

### Adding content

We'll walk though the `pages/index.html` file to (try to) explain how to use this template.

Run `grunt` if you haven't already, which will start the local dev server and open project's home page in your default Web browser.

This tool uses [`grunt-generator`](https://github.com/clavery/grunt-generator) to bake out flat files based on the contents of the `pages/` directory. Each `.html` file in `pages/` is passed through the appropriate Handlebars template in `layouts/`, which, in the case of the [default `story.hbs` template](layouts/story.hbs), wraps it with a nav, Facebook and Twitter meta tags, advertising and drops in scripts and styles.

Because `index.html` is passed through `grunt-generator`, it's treated as a Handlebars template, which means any of the included partials and helpers can be used. Those are documented below.

Each `.html` file in the `pages/` directory also has "frontmatter", which is in JSON format. The following settings are **required** for each page:

```js
{
  "template" : "story", // sets the template from layouts/ to be used
  "title": "Starter template", // will be used as the page title, social share title and etc.
  "description": "This is a starter template", // used as the meta description and social share description
  "thumbnail": "assets/thumbnail.jpg" // a thumbnail for social
}
```

The frontmatter can also be used to create objects that can be passed to the Handlebars helpers. For example, in `index.html` a photo is defined in the frontmatter:

```js
"photo1": {
  "url": "assets/photo.jpg",
  "caption": "newspapers that you'll never read Frontline copyright dingbat CPC, media bias The Weekender WordPress SEO mathewi the notion of the.", // optional
  "credit": "Photographer / Statesman" // optional
}
```

then passed to a Handlebars helper farther down the page to be rendered out as a photo block by `grunt-generator`:

```html
{{> photo-block page.photo1}}
```

Note that in the JSON the context was given a key of `photo1`, then it was passed to the partial as `page.photo1`.

Add more pages by adding additional `.html` files, with the required frontmatter, to the `pages/` directory. Every time you add a page Grunt will automatically build it into a new page in the `public/` folder and refresh your browser.

### Configuring the nav

If you're using the included nav partials (`{{> navbar-thin}}` or `{{> navbar-super}}`) or helpers (`{{navLinks}}` or `{{subNavLinks}}`) you need to configure the nav links they generate by passing them some info in the Gruntfile.

When the nav is compiled, it'll automatically add an active class for the current page and validate each of the links. Watch the Grunt output for any warnings.

Here's an example configuration:

```js
nav: [
  {
    title: "Story 1", // This will be used as the link text
    subtitle: "Explaining story 1", // Optional, used in the super nav
    file: "index", // Should correspond to the file name in pubilc/, without the .html
    children: [ // These are structured the same way as their parent elements, just nested in the children array
      {
        title: "Sub-story 2",
        subtitle: "More on story 2",
        file: "page2"
      },
      {
        title: "Sub-story 3",
        subtitle: "And this is story 3",
        file: "page3"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Story 2",
    subtitle: "More on story 2",
    file: "page2"
  }
]
```

### Changing styles

The project is structured so that only the Bootstrap styles you want are compiled into the final `public/dist/style.css` file. To add and remove Bootstrap Less modules, comment/uncomment the corresponding lines in `src/css/custom-bootstrap/bootstrap.less`. To override Bootstrap variables, edit `src/css/custom-bootstrap/variables.less`.

Custom Less modules can be written and stored in `src/css/` then imported into `src/css/style.less` and will have access to all of Bootstrap's mixins and variables.

See Bootstrap's [Using Less](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#less) for more.

### Using JavaScript

New libraries can be added using Bower. For example, to add tabletop:

```
$ bower add tabletop --save
```

Then, add the project's `.js` files to `Grunt.uglify.prod.files`, as we've already done for jQuery and a few other libraries:

```js
'public/dist/scripts.js': [
  'bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js',
  'bower_components/underscore/underscore.js',
  'bower_components/imagesloaded/imagesloaded.pkgd.js',
  'bower_components/Slides/source/jquery.slides.js',
  'src/js/call-time.js',
  'src/js/slider.js',
  'src/js/main.js'
]
```

The same applies if you'd like to add any of Bootstrap's JavaScript modules, which **aren't included by default**.

You can also write your own JavaScript modules and save them in `src/js/` and add them to the same Grunt array to have them packaged with the final build.

Everything in the `src/js/` folder is passed through [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). If you get a JShint warning that's unclear, you can look it up at [jslinterrors.com](https://jslinterrors.com/).

If you have some bespoke javascript

### Deploying

The included [grunt-ftpush](https://github.com/inossidabile/grunt-ftpush) task will deploy the `public` folder through ftp as configured in a file called `.ftppass` in the root of the project.

```json
{
  "authKeyVar": {
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

There is also a [grunt-slack-hook](https://github.com/pwalczyszyn/grunt-slack-hook) task configured to publish the url to slack once published. The URL to your slack hook is should be saved in a file called `.slack` in the root folder.

MAKE SURE both `.ftppass` and `.slack` are included in the `.gitignore` for your project.

ALSO MAKE SURE to fill out the `cmg-footer-scripts.hbs` partial for hte project.
